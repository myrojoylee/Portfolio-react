# Portfolio-react

React, you say? Coming up!

Follow my progress with the checklist below:

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer

WHEN I load the portfolio

- [x] THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
- [x] WHEN I view the header
- [x] THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
- [x] WHEN I view the navigation titles
- [x] THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
- [x] WHEN I click on a navigation title
- [x] THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
- [x] WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
- [x] THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
- [x] WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
- [x] THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
- [x] WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
- [x] THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
- [x] WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
- [x] THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
- [x] WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text

- [x] WHEN I enter text into the email address field
- [x] THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
